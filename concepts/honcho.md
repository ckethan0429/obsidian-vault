# Honcho

Honcho is currently best treated as a **working name for the user-understanding / memory-routing layer** in CK's agent stack.

It appeared in CK's recent signal set as a search term, alongside other long-running agent and browser-control topics. Based on the surrounding context, the most useful interpretation is:

- not the raw archive itself
- not the wiki itself
- not the model itself
- but the layer that decides **what should be remembered, promoted, or ignored**

## Working definition

A Honcho-like layer sits between raw signals and durable memory.

It should:
- collect raw inputs from [[interest-signal-sources]] and browser/session traces
- rank what is strategically important
- decide whether something becomes raw evidence, a wiki page, or a transient note
- keep the active agent session aligned with CK's stable preferences and recurring projects

## What Honcho is not

- Not a substitute for [[site-observation-archive]]
- Not a substitute for [[obsidian-vault-integration]]
- Not a substitute for long-term knowledge compilation in the wiki
- Not just a vector database or search index

## Optimal place in the architecture

The cleanest architecture is:

1. **Capture** — browser history, CDP sessions, transcripts, chat titles, and search queries
2. **Classify** — Honcho scores signals by novelty, repetition, and strategic value
3. **Promote** — only durable items become wiki pages or memory entries
4. **Retrieve** — the active agent pulls the right profile/context at the right time
5. **Audit** — stale or low-value memory gets demoted instead of accumulating forever

In other words, Honcho should be the **policy/routing layer** above raw capture and below durable storage.

## Routing policy

For capture-to-wiki work, Honcho should route each signal into one of five buckets:

- **raw_only** — keep the evidence, but do not promote it
- **append_existing** — the capture strengthens an existing durable page
- **promote_to_wiki** — the capture clearly introduces a durable new concept
- **manual_review** — the signal is plausible, but too ambiguous to promote safely
- **discard** — the page is low-signal noise

The default bias should be strict promotion. If several same-day captures repeat the same theme, `append_existing` is usually the right decision; novelty should be reserved for genuinely new durable concepts.

Raw evidence should stay intact. The route decision belongs in the routing layer, not as a rewrite of the source artifact.

## 2026-04-30 refinement example

The same-day 08:00 / 11:00 / 19:00 / 22:00 captures were a clean demonstration of routing discipline.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Cloudflare agents creating accounts, Anthropic's Claude positioning, OpenAI Managed Agents on AWS, Symphony orchestration, and GitHub Copilot cloud-agent / billing updates all strengthened the existing [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] axis.
- Threads / YouTube / Google / GitHub repeated the same harness, phase-parallelism, and operator-economics language rather than opening a new durable topic.

### Kept as `raw_only` or `discard`
- Login / hydration variance, repeated baseline rows, and unrelated social noise were preserved as evidence but not promoted.

### Why this matters
This is the practical Honcho loop: preserve raw evidence, apply strict triage, and promote only the reinforced durable axis.

## Recommended architecture for CK

For CK's stack, the most practical split is:

- **Raw capture**: [[site-observation-archive]], browser history, transcript dumps, SingleFile/ArchiveBox
- **Routing and prioritization**: Honcho
- **Durable synthesis**: wiki pages, especially [[obsidian-vault-integration]]
- **Runtime orchestration**: [[managed-agents-architecture]] and [[agent-client-protocol-and-acpx]]

That keeps the system from turning into a giant unstructured memory blob.

## Why this matters

CK's interest signals are already multi-source and multi-domain. Without a routing layer, everything tends to collapse into either:
- too much raw data, or
- too much over-summarization

A Honcho layer helps preserve the distinction between:
- **evidence**
- **signal**
- **memory**
- **wiki knowledge**
