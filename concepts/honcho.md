# Honcho

Honcho is currently best treated as a **working name for the user-understanding / memory-routing layer** in CK's agent stack.

It appeared in CK's recent signal set as a search term, alongside other long-running agent and browser-control topics. Based on the surrounding context, the most useful interpretation is:

- not the raw archive itself
- not the wiki itself
- not the model itself
- but the layer that decides **what should be remembered, promoted, or ignored**

## Working definition

A Honcho-like layer sits between raw signals and durable memory.

It should:
- collect raw inputs from [[interest-signal-sources]] and browser/session traces
- rank what is strategically important
- decide whether something becomes raw evidence, a wiki page, or a transient note
- keep the active agent session aligned with CK's stable preferences and recurring projects

## What Honcho is not

- Not a substitute for [[site-observation-archive]]
- Not a substitute for [[obsidian-vault-integration]]
- Not a substitute for long-term knowledge compilation in the wiki
- Not just a vector database or search index

## Optimal place in the architecture

The cleanest architecture is:

1. **Capture** — browser history, CDP sessions, transcripts, chat titles, and search queries
2. **Classify** — Honcho scores signals by novelty, repetition, and strategic value
3. **Promote** — only durable items become wiki pages or memory entries
4. **Retrieve** — the active agent pulls the right profile/context at the right time
5. **Audit** — stale or low-value memory gets demoted instead of accumulating forever

In other words, Honcho should be the **policy/routing layer** above raw capture and below durable storage.

## Routing policy

For capture-to-wiki work, Honcho should route each signal into one of five buckets:

- **raw_only** — keep the evidence, but do not promote it
- **append_existing** — the capture strengthens an existing durable page
- **promote_to_wiki** — the capture clearly introduces a durable new concept
- **manual_review** — the signal is plausible, but too ambiguous to promote safely
- **discard** — the page is low-signal noise

The default bias should be strict promotion. If several same-day captures repeat the same theme, `append_existing` is usually the right decision; novelty should be reserved for genuinely new durable concepts.

Raw evidence should stay intact. The route decision belongs in the routing layer, not as a rewrite of the source artifact.

## 2026-04-30 refinement example

The same-day 08:00 / 11:00 / 19:00 / 22:00 captures were a clean demonstration of routing discipline.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Cloudflare agents creating accounts, Anthropic's Claude positioning, OpenAI Managed Agents on AWS, Symphony orchestration, and GitHub Copilot cloud-agent / billing updates all strengthened the existing [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] axis.
- Threads / YouTube / Google / GitHub repeated the same harness, phase-parallelism, and operator-economics language rather than opening a new durable topic.

### Kept as `raw_only` or `discard`
- Login / hydration variance, repeated baseline rows, and unrelated social noise were preserved as evidence but not promoted.

### Why this matters
This is the practical Honcho loop: preserve raw evidence, apply strict triage, and promote only the reinforced durable axis.

## Recommended architecture for CK

For CK's stack, the most practical split is:

- **Raw capture**: [[site-observation-archive]], browser history, transcript dumps, SingleFile/ArchiveBox
- **Routing and prioritization**: Honcho
- **Durable synthesis**: wiki pages, especially [[obsidian-vault-integration]]
- **Runtime orchestration**: [[managed-agents-architecture]] and [[agent-client-protocol-and-acpx]]

That keeps the system from turning into a giant unstructured memory blob.

## Why this matters

CK's interest signals are already multi-source and multi-domain. Without a routing layer, everything tends to collapse into either:
- too much raw data, or
- too much over-summarization

A Honcho layer helps preserve the distinction between:
- **evidence**
- **signal**
- **memory**
- **wiki knowledge**

## 2026-05-02 same-day refinement example

The day split cleanly into reinforcement first, then a narrower packaging/orchestration edge late in the day.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 and 19:00 were reinforcement-heavy: they repeated the existing AI infra / shared-memory / operator-economics axis without a fresh durable branch, so they stayed raw evidence plus triage notes.
- No new durable concept page was justified from the early-day browser surfaces.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] with Cloudflare `Dynamic Workflows`, GitHub Changelog's GPT-5.2 / Codex deprecation, and AWS AgentCore São Paulo.
- 22:00 also strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] by adding Anthropic `Claude for Creative Work` and GitHub Trending's `ruvnet/ruflo`.

### Kept as `discard`
- Noise-heavy YouTube rows and repeated baseline launch/news items that did not change the thesis stayed out of durable promotion.

### Why this matters
The same-day pattern is now explicit: early runs stayed `raw_only`, while the later new-target runs reinforced the existing durable axis instead of justifying a new concept page.

## 2026-05-03 same-day refinement example

The day again split cleanly between early reinforcement and later append_existing signals.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 and 19:00 stayed reinforcement-heavy across Threads, YouTube, GitHub stars, Google My Activity, ChatGPT, and Claude.
- The new details — phase-based parallel work, harness engineering, `web-agent`, `TurboQuant`, `GPT-5.5`, `Kimi AI`, `OpenClaw Ready Box`, and `OMO/OMX Ready Workspace` — still fit existing axes rather than opening a new durable branch.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] with Anthropic's Google/Broadcom compute partnership.
- 22:00 also strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] by adding `n8n-mcp` and `DeepSeek-TUI` on top of the same Claude/MCP/tooling lane.

### Why this matters
The day shows the intended Honcho behavior: keep raw evidence intact, let repetition drive `append_existing`, and reserve `promote_to_wiki` for genuinely new branches.

## 2026-05-04 same-day refinement example

The 2026-05-04 raw set was another reinforcement-heavy day, with the triage split staying strict across all four collection windows.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 stayed raw-only overall: Threads added one frontier-model / technical-leadership post, YouTube added a Claude Code / market-facing video, and Google My Activity surfaced fresh model / harness searches, but none of it opened a new durable branch.
- The morning pass was best preserved as evidence because the new details still sat inside the existing AI-agent / harness / infra / education axis.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 reinforced [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] with Cloudflare `agentic cloud`, Google `subagents`, OpenAI `Managed Agents come to AWS`, and GitHub Copilot agent-mode updates.
- 19:00 mostly reinforced the same axis, while the new operator topics were better absorbed by [[ck-technology-engineering-profile]] and [[ck-investing-and-life-profile]] than by a brand-new concept page.
- 22:00 again strengthened [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] with `agency-agents`, `dexter`, and `cocoindex` on GitHub Trending.

### Why this matters
The day is another clean example of strict routing: preserve the raw evidence, route the strongest repeats into existing pages, and avoid creating a new durable concept when the signal is still the same managed-agent / AI-infra / operator-economics cluster.

## 2026-05-05 same-day refinement example

The 2026-05-05 raw set remained on the same macro-axis across all four windows, so the refinement result is still conservative.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 08:00 added fresh operator examples from YouTube plus ChatGPT/Claude recent lists, but they still fit [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] rather than a new page.
- 11:00 and 22:00 added the clearest new-target delta: Gemini API webhooks, TPU inference speedups, ADK/skills/subagents, AWS observability and agent surfaces, and GitHub Trending context-management / long-horizon agent repos.
- 19:00 made the harness vocabulary explicit (`harness`, `routing`, `triage`, `AIOps/AgentOps`) and reinforced the operator-economics language around Ceph, Proxmox, GPU, and deployment.

### Kept as `raw_only` or `discard`
- Sports, entertainment, and generic YouTube noise stayed in raw evidence only.
- Repeated baseline vendor rows from Anthropic, Cloudflare, GitHub Changelog, and older GitHub Trending items were kept as context rather than promoted.
- No `manual_review` case was strong enough to justify a separate branch.

### Why this matters
This is a clean strict-routing day: the strongest deltas sharpen the existing managed-agent / AI-infra pages, but they do not justify a new durable concept.

## 2026-05-07 same-day refinement example

The 2026-05-07 run is a clean example of strict routing discipline.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 and 19:00 social runs repeated the existing agent / infra / harness / memory / education-led packaging axis.
- The strongest new rows were still mostly reinforcement, so they stayed in raw evidence.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 and 22:00 new-target runs strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] with Anthropic Opus 4.7 / compute, AWS Agent Toolkit / AWS MCP Server / AgentCore Memory metadata, GitHub Copilot CLI enterprise-managed plugins, and service-agent adoption.
- Those signals were concrete platform primitives, not a fresh durable concept.

### Why this matters
The day shows the intended Honcho behavior: keep repeated social signals raw, let strong platform primitives append existing pages, and avoid upgrading reinforcement into a new wiki branch.

## 2026-05-08 new-target refinement example

The 11:00 new-target pass is another strict-routing case.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Anthropic Opus 4.7, OpenAI GPT-5.5-Cyber / voice / trusted-contact items, AWS AgentCore Payments, Google Gemini CLI subagents, and GitHub Copilot CLI multi-model support all strengthen the existing [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] / [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] axis.
- Those items are concrete platform primitives, not a new durable concept.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- Cloudflare and Google AI were checked, but they stayed peripheral relative to the main axis.
- GitHub Trending remained in the same agent/tooling cluster rather than creating a new repo-level branch.

### Why this matters
This run preserves the intended Honcho split: keep raw evidence intact, append the durable operator-control signals, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a new wiki branch.

## 2026-05-08 late-evening refinement example

The 22:00 new-target pass is another strict-routing case.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Google Developers’ agent skills / ADK Go / Gemma 4 cluster, OpenAI’s GPT-5.5 Instant / MRC / ads / PwC items, AWS’s control-plane updates, and GitHub Trending’s agent-harness repos all strengthened the existing [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] / [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] axis.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- Anthropic and Cloudflare were checked, but they remained holdover / peripheral relative to the main story.

### Why this matters
This run preserves the intended Honcho split: keep raw evidence intact, append the durable operator-control signals, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a new wiki branch.

## 2026-05-08 same-day refinement summary

The four same-day windows converged on one routing outcome: reinforcement-only.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 social evidence stayed inside the existing Claude Code / agent workflow / AI infra / operator-economics axis; the fresh setup-tips / plugin post and new GitHub star did not justify a new branch.
- 19:00 social evidence added fresher examples on Threads activity, YouTube, Google My Activity, ChatGPT, and Claude, but they still mapped to the same managed-agents / Proxmox / GPU / memory-routing cluster.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 and 22:00 new-target passes strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] with agent skills, subagents, model lifecycle, control-plane, and infra primitives.

### Why this matters
The day never crossed the threshold for `promote_to_wiki`. The durable reading is sharper, but still the same macro-axis, so the right refinement outcome is to keep the raw evidence intact and let the existing pages absorb the reinforcement.

## 2026-05-09 late-evening new-target routing

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Google Developers’ `Gemini Embedding 2`, `Production-Ready AI Agents`, `A2UI v0.9`, `MaxText`, and `Gemini CLI subagents` clearly strengthen [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and [[managed-agents-practical-summary]].
- GitHub Trending’s `chrome-devtools-mcp`, `agentmemory`, `agent-skills`, `rowboat`, `UI-TARS-desktop`, and `9router` are still inside the same agent / browser / memory / skills lane.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS, and Cloudflare were checked, but they mostly repeated prior evidence or stayed operational.
- GitHub Changelog’s repo-policy and governance changes were useful context, but not strong enough to justify a new durable branch.

### Why this matters
The 22:00 pass is another clean example of strict routing: preserve the raw evidence, append the durable operator-control signals, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a new wiki branch.


## 2026-05-09 same-day refinement summary

The full day stayed inside one durable axis: managed agents / AI infra / browser-control / shared-memory. No new concept crossed the promotion threshold.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- Repeated social-feed noise stayed raw-only when it did not add durable meaning, including noisy YouTube subscriptions and peripheral or repetitive items on Anthropic / AWS / Cloudflare surfaces.
- Threads likes remained largely reinforcement against the existing operator stack rather than a new branch.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 08:00 and 19:00 live social passes reinforced the managed-agents / shared-memory / operator-economics axis with concrete examples rather than new themes.
- The 11:00 and 22:00 new-target passes strengthened the same stack with Codex safety, TPU / Colossus / LiteRT economics, Copilot cloud-agent governance, Gemini Embedding 2, Production-Ready AI Agents, A2UI, MaxText, Gemini CLI subagents, browser-MCP, agentmemory, rowboat, agent-skills, UI-TARS-desktop, and 9router.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new durable concept emerged beyond the existing managed-agent and AI-infra branches.

### Why this matters
- Honcho behaved as intended: preserve the raw evidence, let the durable pages absorb only reinforcement, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a separate branch.

## 2026-05-10 late-evening new-target routing

### Routed as `append_existing`
- GitHub Trending’s `GenericAgent`, `omlx`, and `everything-claude-code` were the only clearly new signals; they strengthen [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] and [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] rather than opening a new branch.
- AWS’s `AWS Marketplace introduces Tax management portal for sellers` stayed operational/raw_only.
- Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cloudflare, and GitHub Changelog were mostly baseline repetition relative to the existing new-target track.

### Why this matters
The 22:00 pass is another clean example of strict routing: keep the raw evidence intact, append the durable operator-control signals, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a separate wiki branch.

## 2026-05-11 same-day refinement summary

The full day stayed inside the same durable axis: managed agents / AI infra / browser-control / shared-memory / skills. No new concept crossed the promotion threshold.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- The 08:00 and 19:00 live social passes repeated the established operator and infra language, so they stayed raw evidence rather than becoming a new branch.
- Repeated YouTube noise and baseline vendor repetition were preserved, but they did not justify promotion.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 11:00 and 22:00 new-target passes were already absorbed into [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] earlier in the day.
- The strongest additions were Google's TPU / LiteRT / Agents CLI / A2UI / MaxText cluster, Cloudflare's Dynamic Workflows and agent provisioning, and GitHub Trending's agent-skills / GenericAgent / browser-control / memory rotation.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new durable concept emerged beyond the existing managed-agent and AI-infra branches.

### Why this matters
- Honcho did its job: keep raw evidence intact, absorb only reinforced durable signals into existing pages, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a new wiki branch.
