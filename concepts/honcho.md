# Honcho

Honcho is currently best treated as a **working name for the user-understanding / memory-routing layer** in CK's agent stack.

It appeared in CK's recent signal set as a search term, alongside other long-running agent and browser-control topics. Based on the surrounding context, the most useful interpretation is:

- not the raw archive itself
- not the wiki itself
- not the model itself
- but the layer that decides **what should be remembered, promoted, or ignored**

## Working definition

A Honcho-like layer sits between raw signals and durable memory.

It should:
- collect raw inputs from [[interest-signal-sources]] and browser/session traces
- rank what is strategically important
- decide whether something becomes raw evidence, a wiki page, or a transient note
- keep the active agent session aligned with CK's stable preferences and recurring projects

## What Honcho is not

- Not a substitute for [[site-observation-archive]]
- Not a substitute for [[obsidian-vault-integration]]
- Not a substitute for long-term knowledge compilation in the wiki
- Not just a vector database or search index

## Optimal place in the architecture

The cleanest architecture is:

1. **Capture** — browser history, CDP sessions, transcripts, chat titles, and search queries
2. **Classify** — Honcho scores signals by novelty, repetition, and strategic value
3. **Promote** — only durable items become wiki pages or memory entries
4. **Retrieve** — the active agent pulls the right profile/context at the right time
5. **Audit** — stale or low-value memory gets demoted instead of accumulating forever

In other words, Honcho should be the **policy/routing layer** above raw capture and below durable storage.

## Routing policy

For capture-to-wiki work, Honcho should route each signal into one of five buckets:

- **raw_only** — keep the evidence, but do not promote it
- **append_existing** — the capture strengthens an existing durable page
- **promote_to_wiki** — the capture clearly introduces a durable new concept
- **manual_review** — the signal is plausible, but too ambiguous to promote safely
- **discard** — the page is low-signal noise

The default bias should be strict promotion. If several same-day captures repeat the same theme, `append_existing` is usually the right decision; novelty should be reserved for genuinely new durable concepts.

Raw evidence should stay intact. The route decision belongs in the routing layer, not as a rewrite of the source artifact.

## 2026-04-30 refinement example

The same-day 08:00 / 11:00 / 19:00 / 22:00 captures were a clean demonstration of routing discipline.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Cloudflare agents creating accounts, Anthropic's Claude positioning, OpenAI Managed Agents on AWS, Symphony orchestration, and GitHub Copilot cloud-agent / billing updates all strengthened the existing [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] axis.
- Threads / YouTube / Google / GitHub repeated the same harness, phase-parallelism, and operator-economics language rather than opening a new durable topic.

### Kept as `raw_only` or `discard`
- Login / hydration variance, repeated baseline rows, and unrelated social noise were preserved as evidence but not promoted.

### Why this matters
This is the practical Honcho loop: preserve raw evidence, apply strict triage, and promote only the reinforced durable axis.

## Recommended architecture for CK

For CK's stack, the most practical split is:

- **Raw capture**: [[site-observation-archive]], browser history, transcript dumps, SingleFile/ArchiveBox
- **Routing and prioritization**: Honcho
- **Durable synthesis**: wiki pages, especially [[obsidian-vault-integration]]
- **Runtime orchestration**: [[managed-agents-architecture]] and [[agent-client-protocol-and-acpx]]

That keeps the system from turning into a giant unstructured memory blob.

## Why this matters

CK's interest signals are already multi-source and multi-domain. Without a routing layer, everything tends to collapse into either:
- too much raw data, or
- too much over-summarization

A Honcho layer helps preserve the distinction between:
- **evidence**
- **signal**
- **memory**
- **wiki knowledge**

## 2026-05-02 same-day refinement example

The day split cleanly into reinforcement first, then a narrower packaging/orchestration edge late in the day.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 and 19:00 were reinforcement-heavy: they repeated the existing AI infra / shared-memory / operator-economics axis without a fresh durable branch, so they stayed raw evidence plus triage notes.
- No new durable concept page was justified from the early-day browser surfaces.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] with Cloudflare `Dynamic Workflows`, GitHub Changelog's GPT-5.2 / Codex deprecation, and AWS AgentCore São Paulo.
- 22:00 also strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] by adding Anthropic `Claude for Creative Work` and GitHub Trending's `ruvnet/ruflo`.

### Kept as `discard`
- Noise-heavy YouTube rows and repeated baseline launch/news items that did not change the thesis stayed out of durable promotion.

### Why this matters
The same-day pattern is now explicit: early runs stayed `raw_only`, while the later new-target runs reinforced the existing durable axis instead of justifying a new concept page.

## 2026-05-03 same-day refinement example

The day again split cleanly between early reinforcement and later append_existing signals.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 and 19:00 stayed reinforcement-heavy across Threads, YouTube, GitHub stars, Google My Activity, ChatGPT, and Claude.
- The new details — phase-based parallel work, harness engineering, `web-agent`, `TurboQuant`, `GPT-5.5`, `Kimi AI`, `OpenClaw Ready Box`, and `OMO/OMX Ready Workspace` — still fit existing axes rather than opening a new durable branch.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] with Anthropic's Google/Broadcom compute partnership.
- 22:00 also strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] by adding `n8n-mcp` and `DeepSeek-TUI` on top of the same Claude/MCP/tooling lane.

### Why this matters
The day shows the intended Honcho behavior: keep raw evidence intact, let repetition drive `append_existing`, and reserve `promote_to_wiki` for genuinely new branches.

## 2026-05-04 same-day refinement example

The 2026-05-04 raw set was another reinforcement-heavy day, with the triage split staying strict across all four collection windows.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 stayed raw-only overall: Threads added one frontier-model / technical-leadership post, YouTube added a Claude Code / market-facing video, and Google My Activity surfaced fresh model / harness searches, but none of it opened a new durable branch.
- The morning pass was best preserved as evidence because the new details still sat inside the existing AI-agent / harness / infra / education axis.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 reinforced [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] with Cloudflare `agentic cloud`, Google `subagents`, OpenAI `Managed Agents come to AWS`, and GitHub Copilot agent-mode updates.
- 19:00 mostly reinforced the same axis, while the new operator topics were better absorbed by [[ck-technology-engineering-profile]] and [[ck-investing-and-life-profile]] than by a brand-new concept page.
- 22:00 again strengthened [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] with `agency-agents`, `dexter`, and `cocoindex` on GitHub Trending.

### Why this matters
The day is another clean example of strict routing: preserve the raw evidence, route the strongest repeats into existing pages, and avoid creating a new durable concept when the signal is still the same managed-agent / AI-infra / operator-economics cluster.

## 2026-05-05 same-day refinement example

The 2026-05-05 raw set remained on the same macro-axis across all four windows, so the refinement result is still conservative.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 08:00 added fresh operator examples from YouTube plus ChatGPT/Claude recent lists, but they still fit [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] rather than a new page.
- 11:00 and 22:00 added the clearest new-target delta: Gemini API webhooks, TPU inference speedups, ADK/skills/subagents, AWS observability and agent surfaces, and GitHub Trending context-management / long-horizon agent repos.
- 19:00 made the harness vocabulary explicit (`harness`, `routing`, `triage`, `AIOps/AgentOps`) and reinforced the operator-economics language around Ceph, Proxmox, GPU, and deployment.

### Kept as `raw_only` or `discard`
- Sports, entertainment, and generic YouTube noise stayed in raw evidence only.
- Repeated baseline vendor rows from Anthropic, Cloudflare, GitHub Changelog, and older GitHub Trending items were kept as context rather than promoted.
- No `manual_review` case was strong enough to justify a separate branch.

### Why this matters
This is a clean strict-routing day: the strongest deltas sharpen the existing managed-agent / AI-infra pages, but they do not justify a new durable concept.

## 2026-05-07 same-day refinement example

The 2026-05-07 run is a clean example of strict routing discipline.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 and 19:00 social runs repeated the existing agent / infra / harness / memory / education-led packaging axis.
- The strongest new rows were still mostly reinforcement, so they stayed in raw evidence.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 and 22:00 new-target runs strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] with Anthropic Opus 4.7 / compute, AWS Agent Toolkit / AWS MCP Server / AgentCore Memory metadata, GitHub Copilot CLI enterprise-managed plugins, and service-agent adoption.
- Those signals were concrete platform primitives, not a fresh durable concept.

### Why this matters
The day shows the intended Honcho behavior: keep repeated social signals raw, let strong platform primitives append existing pages, and avoid upgrading reinforcement into a new wiki branch.

## 2026-05-08 new-target refinement example

The 11:00 new-target pass is another strict-routing case.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Anthropic Opus 4.7, OpenAI GPT-5.5-Cyber / voice / trusted-contact items, AWS AgentCore Payments, Google Gemini CLI subagents, and GitHub Copilot CLI multi-model support all strengthen the existing [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] / [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] axis.
- Those items are concrete platform primitives, not a new durable concept.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- Cloudflare and Google AI were checked, but they stayed peripheral relative to the main axis.
- GitHub Trending remained in the same agent/tooling cluster rather than creating a new repo-level branch.

### Why this matters
This run preserves the intended Honcho split: keep raw evidence intact, append the durable operator-control signals, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a new wiki branch.

## 2026-05-08 late-evening refinement example

The 22:00 new-target pass is another strict-routing case.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Google Developers’ agent skills / ADK Go / Gemma 4 cluster, OpenAI’s GPT-5.5 Instant / MRC / ads / PwC items, AWS’s control-plane updates, and GitHub Trending’s agent-harness repos all strengthened the existing [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] / [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] axis.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- Anthropic and Cloudflare were checked, but they remained holdover / peripheral relative to the main story.

### Why this matters
This run preserves the intended Honcho split: keep raw evidence intact, append the durable operator-control signals, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a new wiki branch.

## 2026-05-08 same-day refinement summary

The four same-day windows converged on one routing outcome: reinforcement-only.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 social evidence stayed inside the existing Claude Code / agent workflow / AI infra / operator-economics axis; the fresh setup-tips / plugin post and new GitHub star did not justify a new branch.
- 19:00 social evidence added fresher examples on Threads activity, YouTube, Google My Activity, ChatGPT, and Claude, but they still mapped to the same managed-agents / Proxmox / GPU / memory-routing cluster.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 and 22:00 new-target passes strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] with agent skills, subagents, model lifecycle, control-plane, and infra primitives.

### Why this matters
The day never crossed the threshold for `promote_to_wiki`. The durable reading is sharper, but still the same macro-axis, so the right refinement outcome is to keep the raw evidence intact and let the existing pages absorb the reinforcement.

## 2026-05-09 late-evening new-target routing

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Google Developers’ `Gemini Embedding 2`, `Production-Ready AI Agents`, `A2UI v0.9`, `MaxText`, and `Gemini CLI subagents` clearly strengthen [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and [[managed-agents-practical-summary]].
- GitHub Trending’s `chrome-devtools-mcp`, `agentmemory`, `agent-skills`, `rowboat`, `UI-TARS-desktop`, and `9router` are still inside the same agent / browser / memory / skills lane.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS, and Cloudflare were checked, but they mostly repeated prior evidence or stayed operational.
- GitHub Changelog’s repo-policy and governance changes were useful context, but not strong enough to justify a new durable branch.

### Why this matters
The 22:00 pass is another clean example of strict routing: preserve the raw evidence, append the durable operator-control signals, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a new wiki branch.


## 2026-05-09 same-day refinement summary

The full day stayed inside one durable axis: managed agents / AI infra / browser-control / shared-memory. No new concept crossed the promotion threshold.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- Repeated social-feed noise stayed raw-only when it did not add durable meaning, including noisy YouTube subscriptions and peripheral or repetitive items on Anthropic / AWS / Cloudflare surfaces.
- Threads likes remained largely reinforcement against the existing operator stack rather than a new branch.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 08:00 and 19:00 live social passes reinforced the managed-agents / shared-memory / operator-economics axis with concrete examples rather than new themes.
- The 11:00 and 22:00 new-target passes strengthened the same stack with Codex safety, TPU / Colossus / LiteRT economics, Copilot cloud-agent governance, Gemini Embedding 2, Production-Ready AI Agents, A2UI, MaxText, Gemini CLI subagents, browser-MCP, agentmemory, rowboat, agent-skills, UI-TARS-desktop, and 9router.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new durable concept emerged beyond the existing managed-agent and AI-infra branches.

### Why this matters
- Honcho behaved as intended: preserve the raw evidence, let the durable pages absorb only reinforcement, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a separate branch.

## 2026-05-10 late-evening new-target routing

### Routed as `append_existing`
- GitHub Trending’s `GenericAgent`, `omlx`, and `everything-claude-code` were the only clearly new signals; they strengthen [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] and [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] rather than opening a new branch.
- AWS’s `AWS Marketplace introduces Tax management portal for sellers` stayed operational/raw_only.
- Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cloudflare, and GitHub Changelog were mostly baseline repetition relative to the existing new-target track.

### Why this matters
The 22:00 pass is another clean example of strict routing: keep the raw evidence intact, append the durable operator-control signals, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a separate wiki branch.

## 2026-05-11 same-day refinement summary

The full day stayed inside the same durable axis: managed agents / AI infra / browser-control / shared-memory / skills. No new concept crossed the promotion threshold.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- The 08:00 and 19:00 live social passes repeated the established operator and infra language, so they stayed raw evidence rather than becoming a new branch.
- Repeated YouTube noise and baseline vendor repetition were preserved, but they did not justify promotion.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 11:00 and 22:00 new-target passes were already absorbed into [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] earlier in the day.
- The strongest additions were Google's TPU / LiteRT / Agents CLI / A2UI / MaxText cluster, Cloudflare's Dynamic Workflows and agent provisioning, and GitHub Trending's agent-skills / GenericAgent / browser-control / memory rotation.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new durable concept emerged beyond the existing managed-agent and AI-infra branches.

### Why this matters
- Honcho did its job: keep raw evidence intact, absorb only reinforced durable signals into existing pages, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a new wiki branch.

## 2026-05-12 same-day refinement summary

The day remained mostly reinforcement-only.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00, 11:00, and 19:00 repeated the established Claude Code / agent / infra / workflow axis.
- Fresh rows like the Threads setup/plugins post, YouTube agent/backbone titles, and ChatGPT / Claude sidebar topics stayed as evidence, not as new durable branches.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 22:00 strengthened [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] and [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] with MCP tool-security framing, Docker sandboxing, vLLM correctness, and Kubernetes substrate maturity.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new branch emerged today.

### Why this matters
- Same-day repetition should stay `raw_only` unless a signal survives across surfaces and becomes durable enough to append an existing page.

## 2026-05-13 same-day refinement summary

The day remained reinforcement-only.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 and 19:00 repeated the established Claude Code / agent / infra / workflow axis.
- Fresh rows like the new GitHub star for `outsourc-e/hermes-workspace`, the Google search trail around Claude Code / GPT-5.5 / opencode-go / MCP, the ChatGPT MCP-server note, and the YouTube rotation stayed as evidence, not as a new branch.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 and 22:00 were already absorbed into [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] and [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] earlier in the day.
- The durable additions were long-running agents, governance, sandboxing, security review, pod-level resources, and control-plane automation across Google, OpenAI, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new branch emerged today.

### Why this matters
- Same-day repetition should stay `raw_only` unless a signal survives across surfaces and becomes durable enough to append existing pages.

## 2026-05-14 same-day refinement summary

The 23:00 refinement over the full day’s evidence remained reinforcement-only.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- The 08:00 and 19:00 social passes stayed inside the established Claude Code / agent / infra / memory / education lanes.
- The 19:00 pass added fresh GitHub star rows (`not-claude-code-emulator`, `atomic-hermes`, `hermes-agent`, `memory-bank`, `oh-my-agent`, `web-agent`, `OmniVoice`, `claude-code-best-practice`) and fresh Google search rows (`KRX:071050`, `박동빈`), but they still did not justify a new durable branch.
- Threads, YouTube, ChatGPT, and Claude mostly repeated the existing managed-agents / operator-economics / browser-control language with a few new examples.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 and 22:00 had already appended the day’s durable agent-runtime / sandbox / control-plane / infra-economics signals to `[[managed-agents-practical-summary]]` and `[[ai-infra-operating-economics]]`, so the 23:00 refinement stayed conservative instead of duplicating reinforcement.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new concept emerged today.

### Why this matters
- Same-day repetition should stay `raw_only` unless a signal survives across surfaces and justifies a durable append; by end of day the correct reading is still reinforcement-only.

## 2026-05-15 same-day refinement summary

The full day finished as reinforcement-only: 08:00 appended [[virton-career-and-business-profile]], 11:00 appended [[ai-infra-operating-economics]], 19:00 stayed `raw_only`, and 22:00 appended [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] again.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- The 19:00 afternoon pass repeated the established Claude Code / agent / Proxmox / OpenClaw / shared-memory axis across Threads, YouTube, Google, Claude, and the side surfaces.
- GitHub stars timed out in that run, and the Meta Threads API explorer only returned an unsupported `help` request error, so there was no fresh durable delta there.
- The Claude / shared-memory / OpenClaw packaging conversation stayed within the same education + hosted-workspace + agent-orchestration lane.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 08:00 reinforced [[virton-career-and-business-profile]] with the education + SaaS + hosted-workspace packaging shape around Proxmox / OpenClaw / ready boxes.
- 11:00 reinforced [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] with Genkit middleware, AI Edge, prompt optimization, mTLS, Copilot agent surfaces, Kubernetes DRA maturity, and Hugging Face embeddings / batching.
- 22:00 reinforced [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] again with Codex rollout, AWS Transform agent-builder distribution, Docker MCP catalogs / profiles, and GitHub Trending's skills / NotebookLM / video-agent rows.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No new stable branch emerged.

### Why this matters
- Same-day repetition should stay raw unless it survives across surfaces and clearly deepens an existing page; this day ended as reinforcement-only, with no new durable branch beyond the existing pages already updated earlier in the day.

## 2026-05-16 same-day refinement summary

The 2026-05-16 day also finished as reinforcement-only. The earlier ingest passes had already absorbed the durable changes: 08:00 strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] and created [[hermes-workspace]], 11:00 strengthened [[managed-agents-practical-summary]], 19:00 mostly repeated the same managed-agent / operator-economics lane, and 22:00 strengthened [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] again.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- The 08:00 social pass added fresh Threads operator-economics / vibe-coding evidence, four YouTube agent-backbone rows, and the new `outsourc-e/hermes-workspace` star, but those were already handled by the earlier ingest-stage updates.
- The 19:00 social pass added a couple of new YouTube conversational-agent / skills rows and a few fresh Threads liked rows, while Google / Claude / ChatGPT stayed reinforcement-only and GitHub stars did not yield new readable evidence.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 11:00 new-target pass strengthened [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] and [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] with long-running agents, Gemini CLI subagents, OpenAI Databricks GPT-5.5 / Codex Windows sandboxing, AWS Transform agents / OCI interconnect, Cloudflare Dynamic Workflows, Docker MCP catalogs / governance, GitHub Copilot Memory / cloud-agent task APIs, Kubernetes workload-aware scheduling, and Hugging Face inference-provider packaging.
- The 22:00 new-target pass reinforced [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] again with Genkit middleware, Gemini Embedding 2, Colossus-to-PyTorch throughput, Cloudflare ClickHouse / QUIC analysis, Docker sandboxing, Copilot usage metrics, Kubernetes Mixed Version Proxy / PSI telemetry, Hugging Face embedding / batching, and GitHub Trending's `codegraph`.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new durable branch emerged. The novelty stayed inside the existing managed-agent / AI-infra / control-plane cluster.

### Why this matters
- The right end-of-day reading is still reinforcement-only: preserve the raw evidence, let the earlier ingest passes absorb the durable signals, and avoid duplicating the same-day reinforcement sections in the concept pages again.

## 2026-05-17 same-day afternoon refinement

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 19:00 social pass stayed inside the same managed-agent / AI-infra / memory-routing / education-led packaging cluster that the earlier runs had already established.
- Threads added fresh concrete chatter around `vllm`, `H200`, `Terminus`, `AI 인프라의 진짜 승부처`, and `에이전트 생산성의 진실`, but the underlying theme was still operator economics and agent workflow hygiene.
- YouTube, GitHub stars, Google My Activity, Claude, and ChatGPT all reinforced the same cross-surface stack: AI agents, MCP / skills / subagents, Proxmox / GPU / hosted workspace packaging, and shared-memory / orchestration questions.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- Blank or low-signal surface states such as the YouTube liked shell and downloads empty page stayed in raw evidence only.
- Sports / entertainment noise was preserved in raw capture but not promoted.

### Why this matters
- This pass sharpened the existing durable axis without crossing the threshold into a new wiki branch, so the right move is still strict triage and append_existing rather than promotion.

## 2026-05-18 late-evening new-target refinement

### Routed as `raw_only`
- The 22:00 new-target pass added fresh Google rows around long-running agents, Agent Platform CLI, Gemini CLI subagents, and TPU inference, plus Docker’s coding-agent security series, GitHub’s GPT-5.3-Codex base-model update, Kubernetes route-sync telemetry, and new GitHub Trending agent-native repos.
- Those rows are still inside the same deployable AI infra / managed-agent / control-plane cluster that the 11:00 pass already appended into `[[ai-infra-operating-economics]]`.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new durable branch emerged from the late-evening new-target pass.
- The right move is to preserve the raw evidence and avoid duplicating same-day reinforcement into durable concept pages again.

### Why this matters
- This is the strict Honcho split again: keep the new-target evidence intact, let the existing durable pages carry the concept, and avoid turning same-day feed rotation into a new wiki branch.

## 2026-05-18 same-day refinement summary

The full 2026-05-18 run ended as reinforcement-only at the durable layer.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- The 08:00 and 19:00 social passes stayed inside the existing Claude Code / vibe-coding / AI infra / agent-ops / memory-routing lane.
- The 22:00 new-target pass added long-running agents, Agent Platform CLI, Gemini CLI subagents, Docker coding-agent security, GitHub’s GPT-5.3-Codex update, Kubernetes route-sync telemetry, and new GitHub Trending repos, but those rows still fit the same deployable AI infra / managed-agent / control-plane cluster.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 11:00 new-target pass had already been absorbed into `[[ai-infra-operating-economics]]` earlier in the day, with Genkit Middleware, Gemini Embedding 2, Docker MCP catalogs / profiles, Kubernetes Mixed Version Proxy / PSI, Hugging Face embeddings / batching, and the GitHub Trending agent-native repo rotation.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new durable branch emerged from the day.

### Why this matters
- The right reading for the day is reinforcement-only: preserve the raw evidence, let the 11:00 append stand, and avoid duplicating same-day rotation into new wiki branches.

## 2026-05-19 morning collection note

The morning collection stayed **append_existing**, not `promote_to_wiki`. New YouTube rows on conversational agents, AI stacks, data-center buildout, and local document parsing reinforced the existing routing-layer reading; Threads, GitHub, Google, Claude, and ChatGPT mostly repeated earlier axes.

## 2026-05-19 new-target triage note

The 11:00 new-target pass stayed **append_existing**, not `promote_to_wiki`.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- `OpenAI and Dell partner to bring Codex to hybrid and on-premise enterprise environments`
- `One-click fixes for failing Actions with Copilot cloud agent`
- `Copilot cloud agent: Fast, cost-efficient models for simple tasks`
- `The Open Agent Leaderboard`
- `AWS Management Console now displays AWS Local Zones in the Region Selector`
- `AWS Glue zero-ETL is now available in Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region`
- `Amazon Lightsail CDN distributions now support IPv6-only instances as origins`
- `Project Glasswing: what Mythos showed us`

### Why not `promote_to_wiki`
- The new rows all reinforce the existing deployable AI infra / agent tooling / platform-plumbing axis.
- Google, Microsoft, Kubernetes, and most of GitHub Trending were repetition-heavy compared with the most recent new-target baseline.
- No stable new durable branch emerged.

## 2026-05-19 evening collection note

The 19:00 pass also stayed **append_existing**, not `promote_to_wiki`.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Threads added a `Dart` / `Go` vibecoding row and a phase-based parallel-work / event-based intervention thread, but those still fit the existing agent-workflow discipline axis.
- YouTube added `LLM codegen fails and how to stop 'em`, `Replacing 12K LoC with a 200 LoC Skill`, and watch-later rows like `State of the Claw` and the Claude Code / AI stack items.
- GitHub stars added `memory-bank`, `oh-my-agent`, `firecrawl/web-agent`, and `pyturboquant`, which remain inside the same harness / runtime / quant-adjacent lane.

### Why not `promote_to_wiki`
- The pass sharpened the same durable cluster rather than opening a new one.
- Google and the chat surfaces stayed in the same shared-memory / AI-infra / OpenClaw / Proxmox lane.
- This was reinforcement, so the right move is to preserve the raw evidence and let the existing concept pages absorb the delta.

## 2026-05-19 late-night new-target routing

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Google’s `Announcing Genkit Middleware` and `Building with Gemini Embedding 2` strengthen [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] by making agentic middleware, multimodal retrieval, and production packaging more explicit.
- Docker’s `Docker AI Governance` and GitHub Changelog’s `Audit repository Copilot cloud agent configuration via the REST API` strengthen [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] by turning agent autonomy and cloud-agent configuration into explicit control-plane surfaces.
- GitHub Trending’s `anthropics/claude-plugins-official`, `rohitg00/agentmemory`, `colbymchenry/codegraph`, `multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills`, `obra/superpowers`, `Alishahryar1/free-claude-code`, and `msitarzewski/agency-agents` strengthen [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] and [[claude-code-plugins]] by making plugins, memory, skills, and code-graph packaging concrete.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- OpenAI, AWS, Cloudflare, Microsoft, Kubernetes, and the remaining GitHub Trending rows mostly stayed in the same infrastructure-plumbing or generic packaging lane.

### Why this matters
- The late-night pass still lands inside the same deployable AI infra / managed-agent / skills lane.
- The new rows are useful evidence, but they deepen the existing branch rather than opening a new durable one.

## 2026-05-19 same-day refinement summary

The full day stayed **reinforcement-only** at the durable layer.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- Threads liked rows, Google My Activity, and the remaining social repeats mostly reinforced prior operator-economics and workflow themes.
- X did not appear in the page-target list for this day.
- Low-signal or repetitive surface noise stayed in raw evidence rather than being promoted.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 08:00 pass reinforced [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] with conversational agents, AI stack assembly, data-center buildout, and local document parsing.
- The 11:00 new-target pass reinforced the same axis with Codex, Copilot cloud agent, the Open Agent Leaderboard, and infrastructure plumbing.
- The 19:00 pass reinforced the workflow / memory-routing lane with vibe-coding language choices, phase-based parallel work, and agent-tooling stars.
- The 22:00 pass reinforced [[ai-infra-operating-economics]], [[managed-agents-practical-summary]], and [[claude-code-plugins]] with agentic middleware, governance, plugins, memory, skills, and code-graph packaging.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No stable new durable branch emerged.

### Why this matters
- Preserve the raw evidence, absorb only the reinforced durable axes, and avoid duplicating same-day rotation into a new wiki branch.

## 2026-05-20 same-day refinement summary

The 2026-05-20 collection day stayed reinforcement-heavy at the durable layer. The morning and evening social runs were `raw_only`, the late new-target pass was also `raw_only`, and the only durable update of the day was the earlier 11:00 `append_existing` absorption into [[ai-infra-operating-economics]].

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 and 19:00 Threads / YouTube / GitHub / Google / Claude / ChatGPT mostly repeated the existing AI agent, infra, and memory-routing lane.
- 22:00 official feeds stayed inside the same deployable AI infra / agent tooling / control-plane cluster already established earlier in the week.
- The new surface rows were useful evidence, but they did not cross the promotion threshold.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 11:00 new-target pass, already absorbed earlier in the day, appended [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] with OpenAI content provenance, Cloudflare Claude Managed Agents, GitHub Copilot cloud agent, Docker Gordon, Google LiteRT, and the day’s GitHub Trending rotation.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No new durable concept emerged.
- Repetition across surfaces was reinforcement, not a new branch.

### Why this matters
- Keep the raw evidence intact.
- Let the existing AI infra / managed-agent pages absorb the durable delta.
- Avoid duplicating same-day reinforcement sections across multiple pages.

## 2026-05-21 new-target refinement summary

The 11:00 official-feed pass stayed inside the established durable lane, but it made the control-plane side of the thesis more explicit.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- OpenAI, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Docker, and GitHub all reinforced the same deployable AI infra / agent-control-plane cluster.
- The freshest rows were about MCP, governance, code-review automation, model routing, and deployment packaging, so they belong in the existing pages rather than a new branch.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- Cloudflare and Kubernetes were still useful evidence, but they mostly repeated the prior baseline rather than changing the interpretation.

### Why this matters
- Preserve the feed evidence, absorb the durable control-plane delta into the existing concept pages, and keep the routing layer strict about novelty.

## 2026-05-21 same-day refinement summary

The full day stayed reinforcement-only at the durable layer. Earlier same-day ingest already absorbed the strongest deltas, so the 23:00 refinement stayed conservative instead of duplicating them.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- The 08:00 social pass stayed inside the existing agent / infra / memory-routing / education-packaging lane, even though Google My Activity rotated through fresher Claude Code / Threads API / OpenClaw / ngrok / M365 Graph searches.
- The 19:00 social pass added lower-feed YouTube rows and deeper Threads activity rows, but they still read as reinforcement rather than a new branch.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 11:00 new-target pass had already been absorbed earlier in the day into [[ai-infra-operating-economics]], [[managed-agents-practical-summary]], and [[honcho]].
- The 22:00 new-target pass also stayed in `append_existing`, adding provenance / embedding / batching / agent-tooling rotation on top of the same deployable AI infra thesis.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No new durable concept emerged from the 23:00 review.
- The correct outcome is to keep the raw evidence intact and avoid repeating the same reinforcement sections across multiple durable pages.

### Why this matters
- A reinforcement-only day should leave the wiki stable: preserve evidence, keep the durable pages minimal, and record the routing decision once in Honcho.

## 2026-05-22 new-target refinement summary

The 11:00 official-feed pass stayed inside the established durable lane, but it made the governance / packaging side of the thesis more explicit.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- OpenAI, AWS, Cloudflare, Google, Docker, GitHub Changelog, and GitHub Trending all reinforced the same deployable AI infra / agent-control-plane axis.
- The strongest fresh rows were the ones that turned agent work into explicit enterprise surfaces: OpenAI-compatible inference, Claude compliance, MCP catalogs/profiles, auto model routing, and official plugin / skills packaging.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- Hugging Face and Kubernetes stayed mostly as supporting background on models, inference, and scheduling.
- Lower-signal repeated rows were preserved in raw evidence but not promoted.

### Why this matters
- Preserve the feed evidence, absorb the durable control-plane delta into the existing concept pages, and keep the routing layer strict about novelty.

## 2026-05-22 late-evening social refinement summary

The 19:00 social pass stayed reinforcement-only.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- Threads likes, profile, reposts, replies, YouTube subscriptions / watch later / downloads, GitHub stars, Google My Activity, Claude, and ChatGPT all stayed inside the existing AI infra / managed agents / memory-routing lane.
- The freshest-looking rows were in Threads activity: `phase마다 나눠서 병렬 작업합니다`, `memory-bank, oh-my-agent`, `Ceph·Proxmox·GPU 인프라`, `AI 인프라의 진짜 승부처`, and `git checkout/worktree` isolation. They still reinforced existing pages instead of justifying a new branch.

### Not routed as `append_existing`
- No page received a materially new durable delta from the 19:00 pass.
- This run should remain an auditable raw capture plus a single Honcho note.

### Why this matters
- Reinforcement-only social passes should keep the wiki stable: preserve the evidence, avoid duplicating durable sections, and log the routing decision once.

## 2026-05-22 final same-day refinement summary

The 23:00 refinement pass confirms the whole day as reinforcement-only at the durable layer.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 social surfaces repeated the established Threads / YouTube / GitHub stars / Google My Activity / Claude / ChatGPT lane.
- 19:00 added fresher Threads activity rows around phase-based parallelism, memory-bank / oh-my-agent, and Ceph·Proxmox·GPU economics, but they still reinforced existing pages.
- 22:00 rotated Microsoft DevBlogs’ `AX stack` and GitHub Trending’s `RuView` / control-plane repos, but they remained inside the same deployable AI infra / agent-tooling axis and did not justify another durable delta.

### Not routed as `append_existing`
- No concept page received a new durable delta from the final refinement pass.
- The day’s substantive durable updates were already absorbed by the earlier 11:00 new-target pass.

### Why this matters
- Preserve the raw evidence, avoid restamping the same-day reinforcement into concept pages, and keep the wiki stable.

## 2026-05-23 new-target refinement summary

The 11:00 official-feed pass stayed inside the established durable lane, but it made the enterprise coding-agent, governance, and supply-chain layers more explicit.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- Anthropic, OpenAI, AWS, Microsoft, GitHub Changelog, and Hugging Face all reinforced the same deployable AI infra / managed-agent / control-plane axis.
- The strongest fresh rows were the ones that turned agent work into explicit enterprise surfaces: enterprise coding-agent recognition, Claude partnerships/acquisition, AWS SageMaker domain governance, agentic migration assessment, and npm supply-chain controls.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- Cloudflare, Google Developers, Docker, Google AI Blog, and most of Kubernetes mostly repeated the prior baseline.
- GitHub Trending stayed in the same agent-tooling cluster, with `RuView` as the only clearly new oddball repo.

### Why this matters
- Preserve the raw evidence, absorb the durable delta into the existing concept pages, and keep the routing layer strict about novelty.

## 2026-05-23 same-day refinement summary

The full day stayed on the same durable axis, and the earlier ingest-stage runs already absorbed the meaningful 11:00 / 22:00 deltas. By the time of the 23:00 refinement pass, the right call was to preserve raw evidence and avoid restamping the same reinforcement into concept pages.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- The 08:00 and 19:00 social surfaces (Threads, YouTube, GitHub stars, Google My Activity, Claude, ChatGPT) rotated fresh rows, but they still stayed inside the existing AI infra / managed-agents / memory-routing lane.
- The 23:00 refinement pass did not need to promote any new branch; the earlier same-day durable updates had already absorbed the only meaningful deltas.

### Kept out of duplicate durable promotion
- The 11:00 and 22:00 new-target deltas were already absorbed earlier in the day by the existing concept pages, so the refinement pass intentionally did not repeat them.
- No new durable page or index change was justified from the evening pass.

### Why this matters
- Preserve the raw evidence, keep same-day repetition from bloating durable pages, and treat the day as reinforcement-only at the 23:00 refinement layer.

## 2026-05-24 morning collection summary

The 08:00 pass stayed reinforcement-only at the durable layer.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- Threads liked/activity/profile/reposts/replies stayed in the same AI tooling / operator-economics / memory-routing lane.
- YouTube remained dominated by AI agent, infra, and coding-workflow videos with the same recurring authors and topics.
- GitHub stars, Google My Activity, Claude, and ChatGPT all repeated the same core themes instead of opening a new durable branch.

### Why this matters
- Morning repeats should stay raw-only unless the signal survives across surfaces and becomes durable enough to append existing pages.
- Preserve the evidence, avoid duplicating the same-day reinforcement into concept pages, and keep the wiki stable.

## 2026-05-24 same-day refinement summary

The full day still sat on the same durable axis. The earlier ingest-stage passes had already absorbed the only meaningful durable delta, so the 23:00 refinement layer should preserve the raw evidence and avoid restamping the same reinforcement into concept pages.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- The 08:00 and 19:00 social surfaces (Threads, YouTube, GitHub stars, Google My Activity, Claude, ChatGPT) rotated fresh rows, but they stayed inside the existing AI infra / managed-agents / memory-routing lane.
- The 11:00 new-target pass was reinforcement-only, and the 22:00 new-target pass had already absorbed the only durable delta by appending the managed-agents summary.

### Kept out of duplicate durable promotion
- No new concept page was justified, and `index.md` did not need a change.
- The refinement layer's job was limited to recording the triage decision in Honcho and appending the log entry.

### Why this matters
- Keep same-day repetition from bloating durable pages and treat the day as reinforcement-only at the 23:00 layer.
- Preserve the raw transcript trail so later sessions can compare the repeated axes without re-promoting them.

## 2026-05-25 new-target routing

### Routed as `append_existing`
- AWS Security Agent's verification-script launch, Docker AI Governance, Microsoft's `Securing MCP`, and GitHub Trending's Claude workspace / cookbook repos all strengthened [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] and [[ai-infra-operating-economics]] rather than opening a new branch.
- GitHub Changelog's Copilot metrics / model-selection updates were supporting control-plane evidence, not a separate concept.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- Cloudflare, Google, Hugging Face, Kubernetes, and most of the remaining feed rows were either reinforcement or adjacent infrastructure noise.

### Why this matters
- The correct triage is to preserve the raw evidence, absorb the governance/control-plane delta into existing pages, and avoid promoting feed rotation into a new wiki branch.

## 2026-05-25 same-day refinement summary

The full day stayed reinforcement-only at the durable layer. The earlier ingest-stage updates had already absorbed the only durable delta from the 22:00 new-target pass, so the 23:00 refinement pass kept raw evidence intact and avoided restamping the same signal into concept pages.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 stayed inside the same AI infra / agent / memory-routing / education lane as the recent baseline.
- 11:00 stayed reinforcement-heavy: official feeds mostly repeated, with AWS and GitHub Trending rotating only adjacent control-plane / tooling rows.
- 19:00 again repeated the same Threads / YouTube / GitHub stars / Claude / ChatGPT lane; Google My Activity was unstable and did not hydrate safely enough to treat as new evidence.

### Already absorbed earlier in the day
- 22:00 produced the only durable delta of the day — AWS Security Agent verification scripts, Docker AI Governance, Microsoft `Securing MCP`, and the GitHub Trending Claude workspace / cookbook cluster — but that reinforcement had already been absorbed during ingest-stage updates to [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] and [[ai-infra-operating-economics]].
- Because that durable change was already applied, the refinement layer did not need to touch concept pages again.
- `index.md` remained unchanged.

### Why this matters
This keeps the audit trail explicit: preserve the raw transcripts, let ingest-stage updates absorb any durable delta once, and keep the 23:00 refinement pass from duplicating same-day reinforcement across durable pages.

## 2026-05-26 19:00 reinforcement summary

The afternoon pass stayed `raw_only` at the durable layer.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- GitHub Stars rotated through `not-claude-code-emulator`, `atomic-hermes`, `web-agent`, `pyturboquant`, `claude-code-best-practice`, and `hermes-workspace`, but those repos were still inside the existing Claude Code / agent harness / shared-memory lane.
- Threads likes and activity repeated VC, vibe-coding, phase-based parallel work, memory-bank / oh-my-agent, Ceph·Proxmox·GPU, and AI-infra economics themes.
- YouTube subscriptions and watch-later rotated fresh AI agent / Claude Code / skill / MCP / data-center rows, but the feed still stayed on the same operator-economics axis.
- Google My Activity, ChatGPT, and Claude reinforced the same memory-routing, OpenClaw, Proxmox/GPU, and education-led packaging themes.

### Why this matters
- This pass adds evidence but not a new durable branch; preserve the raw transcript, avoid duplicating same-day reinforcement into concept pages, and leave `index.md` unchanged.

## 2026-05-26 22:00 new-target routing

### Routed as `append_existing`
- GitHub Trending added `Lum1104/Understand-Anything` and `thedotmack/claude-mem`, which reinforce the code-graph and persistent-context lanes already visible in the agent/workspace cluster.
- Docker added `The Untrusted Autonomous Workload: How AI Coding Agents Reshape What Isolation Has to Do`, and GitHub Changelog added `Code coverage on pull requests is now in public preview`; both are durable control-plane / quality-control signals rather than a new macro-axis.

### Why this matters
- The pass still sits inside the managed-agent / control-plane axis, so the right action is a minimal append to existing pages rather than a new concept page.

## 2026-05-26 23:00 same-day refinement summary

The full day remained reinforcement-only at the durable layer. Earlier ingest-stage updates had already absorbed the durable 11:00 and 22:00 deltas, so the 23:00 refinement kept raw evidence intact and did not restamp the same signal into concept pages.

### Routed as `raw_only`
- 08:00 had one fresh GitHub Stars candidate (`smithersai/claude-p`), but Threads, Google My Activity, and YouTube stayed reinforcement-only.
- 19:00 repeated the same Threads / YouTube / GitHub Stars / Google / ChatGPT / Claude lane without opening a new branch.

### Routed as `append_existing`
- 11:00 and 22:00 had already been absorbed into `[[managed-agents-practical-summary]]` as control-plane, governance, packaging, code-graph, persistent-context, isolation, and code-quality reinforcement.
- Because that durable change was already applied earlier in the day, the 23:00 refinement did not need to touch concept pages again.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No new durable concept emerged from the 23:00 review.
- `index.md` remained unchanged.

### Why this matters
- Preserve raw evidence, let ingest-stage updates absorb durable deltas once, and avoid duplicating same-day reinforcement across the wiki.

## 2026-05-28 new-target routing

### Routed as `append_existing`
- The 11:00 official-feed pass added fresh durable reinforcement from OpenAI Codex enterprise/self-improving-agent rows, GitHub Copilot Memory/model/code-quality controls, Google Pay UCP/MCP agentic-commerce support, AWS SageMaker GPU/Bedrock quota surfaces, Microsoft agent-consumer framing, and Hugging Face ITBench-AA.
- Those rows are strong enough to append [[managed-agents-practical-summary]] and [[ai-infra-operating-economics]], but they still sit inside the existing managed-agent / AI-infra control-plane axis.

### Kept as `raw_only`
- Cloudflare Claude Compliance / Managed Agents and Docker autonomous-workload isolation were useful but mostly repeated recent baselines.
- GitHub Trending rotated several agent/tooling repos, but most remained in the already-tracked Claude Code / harness / skills / code-graph lane.

### Not routed as `promote_to_wiki`
- No new durable concept branch emerged; strict routing favored `append_existing` plus raw preservation.
- `index.md` did not need a change because no new page was created.

### Why this matters
- The routing decision preserves the evidence while keeping durable wiki updates focused on the existing pages that already own the concept.
